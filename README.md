# Note Taker

For this project, the goal was to create a server.js backend to work with the supplied front end to make a note taker app.

## Installation

In order to use the application, first clone the repo. Then, using a terminal in the root folder of the project, run npm init if not done already. Once that is done, run npm installs for express and fs. 

## Using the application

Once these packages are installed, all that's left to do is to run server.js using the by entering into the terminal (in the project root directory): node server.js

This will kick off the express.js server (localhost3001)

Now in your web browser url, enter: http://localhost:3001/

There is a save button that only shows when the note is ready (has both a title and text in the body).
The plus button lets you start a new note without saving whatever you have currently entered.
